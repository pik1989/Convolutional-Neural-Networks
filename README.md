# End to End Tutorial on CNN + Pre-Trained Models

### Introduction
Welcome to this repository, your one-stop-shop for convolutional neural network codes and pre-trained models. This repository contains everything you need to get started with CNNs, including code for training and fine-tuning models, pre-trained models for popular image classification tasks, and examples of how to use these models in your own projects. Whether you're a seasoned deep learning practitioner or just getting started with CNNs, this repository has everything you need to level up your computer vision skills.
